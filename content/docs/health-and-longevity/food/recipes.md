## Creating New Recipes

If you're interested in experimenting with new food combinations, one technique
that has served me pretty well I call the "trifecta of flavor".  The way it
works is you take two foods that go well together (e.g. banana and peanut
butter) and you add a third food that goes well with one of the foods but would
be weird to combine with the other (e.g. spinach in this case).  More often
than not, the result is actually pretty good!

## Bread Machine

### Oat Wheat Bread

Excellent texture, despite collapsing top.

 - 1.3 cups water, warm is better i think?
 - 1.5 tbsp brown sugar
 - 1.5 tbsp olive oil
 - 0.9 tsp 50/50 NaCl KCl
 - 1 cup rolled oats
 - 2.5 cups whole wheat flour
 - 1.5 tsp standard yeast that is not too old

Put in bread pan in order listed, then use whole wheat cycle / 1.5 lb loaf.


### Black Bean Bread

 - 1  cup  water
 - 3/4  cup  black beans, dry, cooked, drained  
 - 1 1/2  tablespoons  applesauce
 - 1 1/2  tablespoons  honey
 - ¾  teaspoon  salt
 - 1 1/2  cups  whole-wheat flour
 - 1 1/2  cups  bread flour
 - 1 1/2  teaspoons  yeast, active dry

 Use whole wheat cycle on 1.5 lb loaf.

## Oats

### Basic

 - 1 cup rolled oats
 - 2 cups water
 - 1/4 tsp salt

Microwave for 3 mins.

### Creamy with Frozen Fruit

 - 0.6 cup rolled oats
 - 0.6 cup almond flour
 - water to cover
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 3ish cups frozen fruit

Mix everything, then add frozen fruit on top.

Microwave for 10 mins.

### Overnight

To make overnight oats, use the same ratios, but just leave the oats in the
fridge overnight instead of cooking. I highly recommend addng chia seeds and/or
coconut and/or some other kind of nut + some fruit when making overnight oats.
Yogurt is also good.


## Microwave Breads

Very flexible recipe, an example base:

 - One part unflavored pea protein powder
 - One part rolled oats
 - One part whole wheat flour

Add enough water to make a runny dough.
Microwave for ~5-10 minutes depending on water level and if you added frozen
fruit or not.

This recipe is pretty bland: I recommend adding more stuff for flavor, like:

 - Poppy seeds
 - Lemon Juice
 - Banana
 - Frozen Berries
 - Cocoa powder
 - Egg

## Microwave Steam Bowls

A really easy and convenient way to make some pretty tasty (and healthy!) food.
The basic premise is that you add your vegetables with a splash of water to a
bowl, cover it with a plate, and microwave for 5-8 minutes. Then you add extra
flavors and enjoy! It's easy to get creative with the cooking technique, but
here are some examples:

### Carrots/Onions

Chop carrots and onions, add water and cook, finish with almond butter and
salt.  Add chia seeds optionally to soak up the water!

### Thai Carrots/Onions

Same recipe as before, but instead of almond butter, use natural (e.g. Adams)
peanut butter with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and optionally lime juice.

### Honey Walnut Shrimp Inspired

Chop cabbage, add water and cook with brown rice, finish with walnuts and
mayonnaise. 

## Potatoes

Poke some holes in them, and just throw them into the microwave whole for 5-8
minutes depending on size.

## Roasted Vegetables

All at 425F.

Vegetable      | Size     | Time (mins)
---------      | -------- | -----------
Potato         | 1/2 in   | 40 - 50
Zucchini       | 1/2 in   | 20
Broccoli       | floret   | 20
Brussel Sprout | halved   | 20
Tomato (roma)  | sliced   | 15

See also [this
chart](https://www.myfrugalhome.com/vegetable-roasting-times-chart/).

Add thyme, rosemary, salt, garlic for extra flavor!  Add olive oil after or
before.

## Soup

Saute (cook) onions, carrots, and/or celery for ~5 minutes in a soup pot with
some olive oil.  Add garlic and cook for ~1 more minute.

Next, add a bunch of either stock or water with stock concentrate (e.g. "Better
Than Bullion") and add chopped ingredients to boil based on this time table:

Ingredient      | Time (mins)
---------       | -----------
Beans           | 90-120 + presoaking overnight
Greens          | 3-5
Green beans     | 3
Lentils         | 25
Potatoes        | 20
Barley          | 50
Pasta           | 8-12
Brown Rice      | 45
White Rice      | 15

This table is also accurate for just boiling anything - not necessarily as a
part of a soup.

## Grains and Beans

I have an instant pot and use it to cook grains and beans more quickly.

Ingredient      | Time (mins)
---------       | -----------
Chickpeas       | 28

Use 1 tbsp salt to 1 lb dry beans.
Soak dry beans overnight if possible.
If not, soak as long as you can and add 5-10 mins to the cooking time.

## Ingredients

### Flax Peanut Butter

Mixing ground flaxseed and natural peanut butter in around a 1:1 ratio makes a
great nut butter!  You'll need to add some water to make it a paste (and not
just powdery).  

This recipe has a good omega-3/6 ratio too.  Per 100g, peanut butter has 9.7g
omega-6 and 0.3g omega-3 fatty acids.  Per 100g, flax seeds have 5.9g omega-6
and 22.8g omega-3 fatty acids.  So combined, we have 23.1g omega3 and 15.6g
omega-6, a **~1.5 ratio**!  Data was taken from NCCDB via Cronometer.

### Apple Crisp

Filling:
 - ~5 apples
 - ~3 tbsp chia seeds
 - ~1 tbsp lemon juice
 - dusting of cinnamon

 - 5 egg yolks
 - 1/2 cup sugar, more for topping

1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and salt
   and cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then
   discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)
2. In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of
   the cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir.
   Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a baking dish; fill
   dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake for 30 to 40
   minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. Refrigerate for
   several hours and up to a couple of days.
3. When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a
