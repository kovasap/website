## Optimizing Mahir

Mahir's passive ability encourages getting 6 points in a skill tree ASAP, then
moving on to another tree.
Therefore, to get the most out of his passive, making a build becomes a game with these "rules":

1. Find good 6-ability sets in trees that make sense together.
2. Figure out what order you can take the sets in (assuming you unlock abilities
   via skill point progress and not getting treatises).
3. Make sure that order makes the game fun to play and not too hard.
   Mix trees accordingly.

I've noticed that axe, dagger, and dual wield skill trees provide 6 useful
abilities that are possible to get early.
These trees also have a variety of skippable abilities, making them a good
starting point for this build.

From there, I came up with a ranged / dual wield hybrid build idea where I would
do ranged damage mostly, but instead of kiting forever (which I find boring), I
would finish enemies with a axe / dagger dual wield abilties.

Ideally, this build never does basic attacks, as it has plenty of abilities to use.

This build puts all skill points into perception, then maybe willpower later.
"The best defense is a good offense!"

My 6-ability sets with pick order are as follows:

### Atheletics

 - "Leg sweep" (1st pick).
   *Just makes the early game much more tolerable, and is always useful to reset
   bad situations.*
 - "Inner Reserves" (26th).
 - "Not this time" (27th).
 - "Sudden Lunge" (28th).
 - "No Time to Linger" (29th).
 - "Elusiveness" (30th).

### Ranged Weapons

We take two abilties early make the weapons usable, then get the rest later.

 - "Take Aim" (2nd pick).
 - "Dexterity" (3rd pick).
 - "Constant Practice" (22nd).
 - "Startling Volley" (23rd).
 - "Spot Weakness" (24th).
 - "Longshot" (25th).

### Daggers

This is the first tree we will get the set of 6 in, as it's at this point we can
tier 2 abilities via our perception.

 - "Double Lunge" (4th).
 - "Gaping Wound" (5th).
 - "From the Shadows" (6th).
 - "Painful Stabs" (7th).
 - "Quick Hands" (8th).
 - "Weakening Jabs" (9th).
 - "Coup de Grace" (31st).

### Dual Wielding

Our second set of 6.

 - "Dual Wielding Training" (10th).
 - "Flurry of Strikes" (11th).
 - "Concentration" (12th).
 - "Dying Fervor" (13th).
 - "Deflect" (14th).
 - "Berserk Tradition" (15th).

### Axes

Our third set of 6.  The charge skill now means we can kill the troll easily!

 - "Mutilating Lunge" (16th).
 - "Cut Through" (17th).
 - "Ferocity" (18th).
 - "No Mercy" (19th).
 - "Reprisal" (20th).
 - "Execution" (21st).

We can fill out the trees or do whatever now with our extra ability points!
