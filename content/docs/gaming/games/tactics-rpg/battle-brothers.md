{{< game-img "battle-brothers" "400px" >}}

Good tactical RPG set in a low fantasy world.
Lots of character customization via different weapon types, and stat/perk
assignment on level up.
Not to mention the starting stats given to each character.

## Build Ideas

Builds that I used for some of my vanilla playthroughs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1roXzfQcoudn073bf7BsIQQbeax3z3JoyxRfDRcV9Tf0/edit?gid=0#gid=0

### Headhunter flail -> axe

Need a high FAT, high mATK bro.
The idea is you lash to hit the head with a flail, then quick hands into a 1h
axe and do very high headshot damage.

### Double Grip Mace / Qatal

Need quick hands and good mATK/mDEF.  Daze with mace, then Qatal.  

### Kingfisher Qatal

Need kingfisher and offhand mastery for trip artist.

## Roles / "Classes"

The more I get into the endgame the more I realize how much survivability is
important on bros.

My next run I want to have a really solid frontline full of high defense shield
bros using phalanx, then swap out the damaging backline based on the opponent.

## RNG

Unfortunately, the randomness in this game will lead to characters dying, so if
you want to preserve specific characters get ready to save and load a lot :).
This game is pretty hard and doesn't necessarily give you direct feedback as to
why you are failing.
The combat uses randomness pretty heavily to determine hit/miss/crit (head hit)
chance, which means that the consequences of your actions are 'fuzzed' - good
decisions will sometimes be punished, and bad ones you will sometimes get away
with.
This means that it's tricky to personally track if your strategy is working
without a decent time investment for each strategy you are trying.

I wish there were mods for this game that let you rebind the WASD camera
controls.
AFAICT there are not.
I tried using https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki/Scripting, but it didn't
seem to work on linux.
Someone online said you can use AutoHotKey via wine but I haven't tried that
yet.

## Tips

 - The game is more fun when not stressing too much about the starting stats of
   your bros.
   I learned this from
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msPS0Gu91Xg&list=WL&index=2 after spending
   too much time on reddit and building my builds spreadsheet linked above.
   Reforged helps with this as the dynamic perks give you something to be
   excited about beyond raw stats in a new recruit.

### Day 3 Famed Item

### Tank Lesson

This fight was particularly hard, and taught me that it's important to have a few forward tanks stall time while everyone else cleans up the necrosavants.
